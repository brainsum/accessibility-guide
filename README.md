# ♿ Web development Accessibility in Mind

## **Why?**

Whether it's SEO or accessibility, the general goal is to be able to offer the same information to everyone, regardless of whether the visitor:

* a human visitor or a scanning robot,&#x20;
* can browse the page with full or partial sensory use:&#x20;
  * blind, low vision (screen reading, zooming, contrast management),&#x20;
  * deaf-mute (audio / video transcriptions),&#x20;
  * has difficulty to reading (e.g. dyslexia),&#x20;
  * finger or hand coordination is challenging (e.g. mouse is not / difficult to use),&#x20;
  * users have to use their other body parts for control instead of hands/fingers,&#x20;
  * users can navigate by themselves or only with the help of an assistant program (even with voice control),
  * potential users may have low(er) cognitive competence.

All page elements should appear to everyone in the same order, same priority, and preferably in the same way. Use assistive information to help the users understand non-text-based elements. Try to make all information available in text format (too) if possible; text-based information is the easiest data format that is processable by assistive or other technologies.
