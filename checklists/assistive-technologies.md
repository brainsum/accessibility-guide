# ðŸ”Š Assistive Technologies

You can use them to navigate primarily with the keyboard. Some may support voice control too.&#x20;

If the user's browser and the visited content in them are properly marked/prepared, the screen readers can recognize the type of web elements and what to do with them. E.g.:

* We can navigate between HTML landmarks.
* The screen readers can tell us we are standing at a link now that is a clickable item, where to leads, and what you need to press to activate this link.&#x20;

In the configurations of most screen readers, you can set what type of items you want to jump.&#x20;

In the configurations, you can choose the narrator's voice, pronunciation, and speed too.

The screen readers can recognize some character combinations, so they don't pronounce characters individually, but by a word (eg. `GIF`, `:-)`).&#x20;
