## :blue\_book:The manual guide

* [ ] Is there a search box in the header?
* [ ] Does the page/meta title describe well your content?
* [ ] Are there any moving elements? Are these elements stoppable?
* [ ] Is it well articulated? Are there any headings and highlights, and all information is organized into groups?
* [ ] Is it easy to read? (line spacing, uppercase/lowercase letters, contrast, etc.)
* [ ] Is there secondary navigation, e.g. breadcrumb?
* [ ] Does it fit all screen sizes? Is there no overlap, or missing parts (overflow)?
* [ ] Is it easy to read on a small screen too?
* [ ] Can it be read @2x zoom? Doesn't break the layout?
* [ ] Can it also be used with a keyboard? Can we use only the TAB for navigation between interactive elements? Can we navigate with screen readers? Is the focus clear?
* [ ] Do we inform the user if a link opens on a new tab?
* [ ] Are the clickable items clear?
* [ ] Is the alt attribute of images used well everywhere?
* [ ] Are the links and buttons used properly?
* [ ] Does the text of the links indicate the purpose of the link?
* [ ] Are the form fields clear? Eg. we use labels for fields, not use a placeholder as the label, etc.
* [ ] Can forms (contact, searchâ€¦) be completed using the keyboard only?
* [ ] In case of incorrect form submission, there is an error message and the location of the error?
* [ ] Does the form ask the user to check again before finally sending the form?&#x20;
* [ ] Is there proper feedback after the successful form submission?
