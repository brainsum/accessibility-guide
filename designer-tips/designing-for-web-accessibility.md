# üìê Designing for Web Accessibility

## Layout, structure

Group the elements according to their affiliation, there should be enough space between the different elements (especially headings).

## Colors

Appropriate color contrast between foreground color and background.

Let's not mark anything with color alone - even a text version.

## Media

In addition to image, video and sound elements, there should also be a text version.

## Forms

Each form element must have a clearly marked label (optionally also a placeholder property)

Clear feedback after submitting the form:&#x20;

* :white\_check\_mark: successful: what will happen next
* :red\_circle: there is an error: then exactly where and we (also don't just color it)

## Interactive elements

Interactive elements should be clearly identified and highlighted.

Automatic sliders: have at least one pause button, but various navigation buttons (arrows, dots - numbers) are also recommended.

## Responsive design

Have a separate dedicated design for different sized devices; e.g. don't just look at your mobile as a scaled-down desktop view, it's designed specifically for it: appropriate text size, line-height, interactive elements, fingers for easy control, and more.
