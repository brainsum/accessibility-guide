# üìê Designing for Web Accessibility

## Layout, structure

Group the belonging together elements, there should be enough space between the different elements (especially headings).

## Colors

Apply the appropriate color contrast between the foreground color and the background.

Let's not mark anything with color alone. It should have a text version too.

You can use plugins for your design software, like:

* [A11y - Color Contrast Checker](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/733159460536249875/A11y---Color-Contrast-Checker) for Figma
* [Cluse](https://cluse.cc) for Sketch

## Media

In addition to the image, video, and sound elements, there should also be a text version.

## Forms

Each form element must have a clearly marked label (optionally also a placeholder property but not the purpose as the label!)

Clear feedback after submitting the form:&#x20;

* :white\_check\_mark: successful: what will happen next,
* :red\_circle: there is an error: exactly where and what is the problem. (Don't mark them with only color too!)

## Interactive elements

Interactive elements should be clearly identified and highlighted.

Automatic sliders: have at least one pause button, but various navigation buttons (arrows, dots - numbers) are also recommended.

## Responsive design

Have a separate dedicated design for different sized devices; e.g. don't just look at your mobile as a scaled-down desktop view, it's designed specifically for it: appropriate text size, line height, interactive elements, fingers for easy control, and more.
