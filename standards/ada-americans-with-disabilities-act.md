# ðŸ“‘ ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act)

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a civil rights law enacted in 1990 that prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in all areas of public life, including jobs, schools, transportation, and all public and private places that are open to the general public. The purpose of the law is to ensure that people with disabilities have the same rights and opportunities as everyone else. The ADA is divided into five titles:

1. Employment (Title I)
2. **Public Services (Title II)**
3. Public Accommodations (Title III)
4. Telecommunications (Title IV)
5. Miscellaneous Provisions (Title V)

Enforced by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and other federal agencies. Non-compliance can lead to legal action.

**Compliance**: Increasingly, courts and regulators reference WCAG standards when evaluating ADA compliance for digital accessibility. Reporting based on [**WCAG 2.X AA**](web-content-accessibility-guidelines-wcag.md) is recommended.
