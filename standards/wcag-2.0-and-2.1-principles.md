# â˜‘ WCAG 2.0 and 2.1 principles

## **Perceivable**

* Make all elements of content and UI accessible to everyone&#x20;
* Easier to distinguish&#x20;
* Text alternatives (for non-text items)&#x20;
* Time-based media: timestamp text version&#x20;
* Audio alternative or screen reader

## Operable

* Keyboard control&#x20;
* Ensure sufficient time (e.g. sliders, < 20 hours for temporary content and we need to inform the user)
* Avoid causing epileptic seizures (flickering)
* Navigability (easy to find content: navigation, search, skip blocks, headings, multiple paths)

## **Understandable**

* Readability (content, text should not be in the image)&#x20;
* Predictability: regular, consistent operation&#x20;
* Input support: help filling out a form, avoiding errors/ways to fix them, help

## **Robust**

* Compatibility: run on as many devices as possible, including assistive technologies&#x20;
* Incorporate features to optimize and customize running on different devices
