# ðŸ“‘ Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

Guidelines and recommendations for the web content presentation put together by the W3C [_Web Accessibility Initiative_](https://www.w3.org/WAI/). The WCAG deals with several different web technologies, and in addition to HTML, it includes rules for PDF, Flash, Silverlight, and screen readers.

## **Levels**

There are 3 levels of compliance; the higher the level = the more user-friendly:

### **Level A**

Basic level, at least we have to achieve this!

### Level AA

<mark style="color:purple;">**Usually, the governments/legal texts require this level!**</mark>

### Level AAA

For the most part, it requires more serious changes, even if we need to radically change the way the website works.

{% hint style="info" %}
In the [WCAG 2.2 in the practice section](../wcag-2.x-in-the-practice/), we marked all rules with their level.
