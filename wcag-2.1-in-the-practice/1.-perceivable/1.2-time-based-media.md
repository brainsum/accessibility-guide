# ⏯ 1.2 Time-based Media

We need to provide alternatives to time-based media. It could be video or audio, we should provide a format that everyone can perceive more easily.

## Transcripts (A)

For pre-recorded videos and audio files, we should provide a text version with a nice articulation.

Transcripts are enough for audio only (e.g. podcasts).

The transcript can be on the same page or a link to it; the point is to be clear about where you can read the content of a particular video/audio.

The transcript can be handwritten (created by own or provided by [specialized offices](http://www.uiaccess.com/transcripts/transcript\_services.html)) or generated by audio recognition programs (e.g. [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/)).

If we can't provide this, upload the audio to an external provider (e.g. YouTube, Spotify, etc.) that can provide audio and (even dubbed) transcripts.

## Captions (A)

For audio, it's _recommended_ to provide a transcript, and for videos, we must provide timestamped subtitles.&#x20;

To do this, you can either use embedded videos where your service provider supports them (e.g. YouTube, Spotify, etc.) or use the `<track>` element of the html5 video for your own videos.

The `<track>` element supports various caption formats such as XML-based TTML or the newer and simpler WebVTT (comparison)

    <track src="myvideo_fr.vtt" kind="captions" srclang="fr" label="French">
</video>
```
{% endcode %}

## Video with audio fallback (A)

We should not forget about special videos about blind users that do not contain human text, or explanations, and only ambient sounds that do not make it clear what is happening in the video.

E.g. spaceship launch, waterfall, musical composition, nature, wildlife, train / flying spotting, etc.

In this case, also provide audio material where what is seen is explained orally.
