# ⏯ 1.2 Time-based Media

We need to provide alternatives to time-based media, be it video or audio, in a format that everyone can perceive more easily.

## Transcripts (A)

For pre-recorded videos and audio files, provide a text version with a nice articulation of who says what.

Transcripts are enough for audio only (e.g. podcasts).

The transcript can be on the same page or one can link to it; the point is to be clear about where you can read the content of a particular video / audio.

The transcript can be handwritten (own or have [specialized offices](http://www.uiaccess.com/transcripts/transcript\_services.html)) or generated by audio recognition programs (e.g. [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/)).

If we can't provide this, upload the audio to an external provider that can provide audio and (even dubbed) transcript.

## Captions (A)

Is _recommended_ for audio with transcript , and for videos we must provide timestamped subtitles.&#x20;

To do this, you can either use embedded videos where your service provider supports it (e.g. YouTube, Spotify, etc.) or use the `<track>` element of the html5 video for your own videos.

The `<track>` element supports various caption formats such as XML-based TTML or the newer and simpler WebVTT (comparison)

    <track src="myvideo_fr.vtt" kind="captions" srclang="fr" label="French">
</video>
```
{% endcode %}

## Video with audio fallback (A)

We should not forget about special videos about blind users that do not contain human text, explanations, only ambient sounds that do not make it clear what is happening in the video.

E.g. spaceship launch, waterfall, musical composition, nature, wildlife, train / flying spotting, etc.

In this case, also provide audio material where what is seen is explained orally.

<a href="Mars_landing_audio.mp3">
    Audio description of "Mars Landing"
</a>
