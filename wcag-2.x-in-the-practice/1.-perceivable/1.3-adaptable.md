# ℹ️ 1.3 Adaptable

The structure and content of the page must be design-independent; should be structured in such a way that it can be displayed in different ways, e.g. in spoken or simplified form.

If the content and structural information are displayed and linked in a way that is intelligible to the software, they can display it to them according to the user's abilities. If it is not possible to cover it with algorithms, we should display only the information that is absolutely necessary for the user and nothing else!

## WAI-ARIA landmarks (A)

Identify parts of the page with ARIA landmarks so the screen readers can use them to jump between them.

{% hint style="warning" %}
<mark style="color:orange;">To achieve this we can use only elements with ARIA roles as children of the</mark> <mark style="color:orange;"></mark><mark style="color:orange;">`<body>`</mark> <mark style="color:orange;"></mark><mark style="color:orange;">element. In this way, all top-level elements have one role from these:</mark> <mark style="color:orange;"></mark><mark style="color:orange;">`banner`</mark><mark style="color:orange;">,</mark> <mark style="color:orange;"></mark><mark style="color:orange;">`mai`</mark><mark style="color:orange;">n,</mark> <mark style="color:orange;"></mark><mark style="color:orange;">`complementary`</mark><mark style="color:orange;">,</mark> <mark style="color:orange;"></mark><mark style="color:orange;">`contentinfo`</mark><mark style="color:orange;">.</mark>
{% endhint %}

1. Identify the logical structure of the page and divide it into different areas.
2. We associate roles with areas of the page.
3. Optionally\* each area individually has `aria-label`, `title` inline property, or `aria-labelledby` property if there is an unspecified heading (`h1` - `h6`) element.

\*if more than one exists of the same type on the page we must label them, but the region role must have a label!

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```html
<div id="header" role="banner">A banner image and introductory title</div>
<div id="sitelookup" role="search"></div>
<div id="none" role="navigation">a list of links here </div>
<div id="content" role="main">Ottawa is the capital of Canada</div>
<div id="rightsideadvert" role="complementary">an advertisement here</div>
<div id="footer" role="contentinfo">(c) The Freedom Company, 123 Freedom Way, Helpville, USA</div>
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="info" %}
All ARIA landmarks should have a title. If you can't provide one, don't use the role property or an HTML5 element with a role (eg. `<section>`).
{% endhint %}

### :blue\_book:Guides

{% embed url="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/example-index/landmarks/index.html" %}
W3C Guide to landmarks
{% endembed %}

## WAI-ARIA `role="heading"` (A)

If for some reason you can't use headings h1 through h6, enter a heading role.

For example, we would need h7 or when we don’t have access to edit the DOM, we can add this role via JS.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```html
<div role="heading">Global News items</div>
<div>a list of global news with editorial comment</div>

<div role="heading">Local News items</div>
<div>a list of local news, with editorial comment</div>
```
{% endcode %}

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```html
<h5>Fruit Trees</h5>
<h6>Apples</h6>
<p>Apples grow on trees in areas known as orchards</p>
<div role="heading" aria-level="7">Jonagold</div>
<p>Jonagold is a cross between the Golden Delicious and Jonathan varieties</p>
```
{% endcode %}

## `aria-labelledby` as landmark title (A)

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you use more than one of the same type of landmarks on the page, each landmark must have a title/name, except for <mark style="color:red;">`region`</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">role where it’s obligatory!</mark>
{% endhint %}

If the first element of the landmark is a heading, it can be used as the title of the landmark by referencing it with `aria-labelledby` (:warning:no need to start with `#`).

If there is no heading element, we must specify it inline in `aria-label` or `title` .

The screen readers will also read the type of landmark and the title of the landmark as we scroll through the landmarks, informing the user which part of the page they are on.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```html
<div role="application" aria-labelledby="calendar-title" aria-describedby="info">
    <h1 id="calendar-title">Calendar<h1>
    <p id="info">
        This calendar shows the game schedule for the Boston Red Sox.
    </p>
 
     <div role="grid">
        ...
    </div>
</div>  
```
{% endcode %}

## `aria-labelledby` for control elements (A)

With the `aria-labelledby` property, you can add labels to items that do not have the same value as another item

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```html
<input name="search__text" type="text" aria-labelledby="search__button">
<input name="search__button" id="search__button" type="submit" value="Search">
```
{% endcode %}

You can specify multiple values for `aria-labelledby`, so that you can combine several related elements if you need to interpret/read them together.

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```html
<label id="notify__label" for="notify__days">Notify me</label>
<select name="notify__days" id="notify__days" aria-labeledby="notify__label notify__days notify__text">
    <option value="1">1</option>
    <option value="2">2</option>
</select>
<span id="notify__text" tabindex="- 1">days in advance</span>
```
{% endcode %}

## WAI-ARIA group properties (A)

Use the group and radio group roles to wrap together all logically related elements.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```html
<div role="group" aria-labeledby="social-security__label">
    <span id="social-security__label">Social Security #</span>
    <span style="color: red;">*</span>
    <input size="3" type="text" aria-required="true" title="First 3 digits">
    -
    <input size="2" type="text" aria-required="true" title="Next 2 digits">
    -
    <input size="4" type="text" aria-required="true" title="Last 4 digits">
</div>
```
{% endcode %}

## WAI-ARIA `role` = `region` (A)

The `region` role is used to identify each area of the page.

If you use HTML5 `<section>` elements, they will have a `region` role by default.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```html
<main>
  <h1>title for main content area<h1>
  <section aria-labelledby="region1">
    <h2 id="region1">title for region area 1</h2>
    ... content for region area 1 ...
  </section>

  <section aria-labelledby="region2">
    <h2 id="region2">title for region area 2</h2>
    ... content for region area 2 ...
  </section>
</main>
```
{% endcode %}

## Semantic DOM (A)

Use as many semantic elements as possible that were also mentioned in the [HTML5 subpage](../../html-for-accessibility/valid-semantic-html5-markup.md).

### **A few examples**

* Avoid meaningless `<div>`, `<span>` elements wherever you can!
* The text of the link should never be the URL itself or general text, but refer to where the link leads.
* `<em>` and `<strong>` to highlight text, but not because you want italic or bold, format them freely!&#x20;
* For a quote should use `<q>` or `<blockquote>` and, if you know, a `<cite>` element to indicate the source_._
* What is listed should be in some list item. [Examples in the WCAG dock.](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H48.html)
* `<p>`, only the really paragraph-like flowing text.
* Mark the abbreviations separately: `<abbr>` - there is a CKEditor plugin for it!

{% code title="Anchor with label" overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```html
<p>Do you want to try our new tool yourself? A free demonstration version is available in our <a href="download.html">download section</a></p>
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="Quote with cite" overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```html
<p>Marriage was considered a logical step for a bachelor, as can be seen in the first chapter of the novel <cite>Pride and Prejudice</cite>:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.</p>
    
    <p>However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.</p>
</blockquote>
```
{% endcode %}

## Marking important information (A)

If we consider some textual information important, it is important that it does not differ only in its appearance.

Not only should it be marked in a larger size, with a bold, a different color, a different font, but always in at least two ways. For example, here the newest is not only bold, but put in `<strong>`**,** and even the word `new`, which is the newest:

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```html
<h2>Web Accessibility Guidelines</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>WCAG 2.0 (New)</strong></li>
    <li>WCAG 1.0</li>
    <li>Section 508</li>
    <li>JIS X 8341-3</li>
    ...
</ul>
```
{% endcode %}

## Separating Content and Display (A)

Don’t confuse the two, each has what it is for: go to HTML - preferably meaningfully differentiated - content, while everything that’s just about display should go into CSS.

Avoid inline css (background images too).

Do not include meaningless elements in your HTML, e.g. spacer, design elements only for css.

pseudo elements (`::after`, `::before`) (e.g. an asterisk in the form), there can only be a design element, which is not a problem if it does not appear.

Never use space between characters for visual purposes (this will give screen readers a separate character, not a word), using the css letter-spacing property.

## WAI-ARIA `img` role for non-**`<img>` images** (A)

The `<img>` element gets the `img` role by default.

We assign the img role to elements that are different but treated as images in appearance.

Such an element is typically an inline / inline SVG (since it is a separate XML document), icon fonts, or combined images of several separate elements.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```html
<p>
    <span class="icon icon-star-bg" role="img" aria-label="Favorite"></span>
</p>
```
{% endcode %}

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```html
<span class="icon-stacked" role="img" aria-label="Favorite star half filled">
    <span class="icon icon-star-bg grey" role="img" aria-hidden="true"></span>
    <span class="icon icon-star-half yellow" role="img" aria-hidden="true"></span>
</span>
```
{% endcode %}

## `<table>` element for tabular display (A)

Use the \<table> element to tabulate data.

In order for software to process the information stored in it well, it is important that at least each column has a header (`<th>` element).

For an even easier interpretation of `<th>` s, add a scope property to indicate whether it applies to a row or column.

For more complex tables, `<th>` and `<td>` can be combined with id and headers properties: we add id to `<th>`, and the corresponding `<th>` and `<td>` elements to in the headers property of the parent `<th>` `id`. [See the WCAG example](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H43.html).

If possible, give the table a title: `<caption>` element.

If possible, add a more detailed description to the `summary` property of the `<table>` element.

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```html
<table summary="Intersections are listed in row 1. Find the intersection closest to your starting point or destination, then read down that column to find out what time the bus leaves that intersection. Service begins at 4:00 AM and ends at midnight.">
    <caption>Schedule for the week of March 6</caption>
    <tr>
        <td> </td>
        <th scope="col">Monday</th>
        <th scope="col">Tuesday</th>
        <th scope="col">Wednesday</th>
        <th scope="col">Thursday</th>
        <th scope="col">Friday</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row"> 8:00-9:00</th>
        <td>Meet with Sam</td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row">9:00-10:00</th>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td>Doctor Williams</td>
        <td>Sam again</td>
        <td>Leave for San Antonio</td>
    </tr>
</table>
```
{% endcode %}

## `<label>` element for all\* `<input>` form elements (A)

`<label>` elements to all `<input>` form elements that are not themselves labels (e**.**g. `<input type="submit">`).

The `placeholder` property is not a `<label>` element!

Where we cannot use the `<label>` element, give the `<input>` element a `title` property.

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```html
<h1>Donut Selection</h1>

<p>Choose the type of donut(s) you would like then select the "purchase donuts" button.</p>

<form action="http://example.com/donut" method="post">
    <p>
        <label for="name">Name* (required):</label> 
        <input type="text" name="name" id="firstname" />
    </p>
    <p>
        <input type="radio" name="flavor" id="choc" value="chocolate" />
        <label for="choc">Chocolate</label>
        <br/>
        <input type="radio" name="flavor" id="cream" value="cream"/>
        <label for="cream">Cream Filled</label>
        <br/>
        <input type="submit" value="Purchase Donuts"/>
    </p>
</form>
```
{% endcode %}

## Named form groups (A)

For larger forms, arrange each form element into `<fieldset>` elements.

Each `<fieldset>` element using an `<legend>` element.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```html
<form action="http://example.com/adduser" method="post">
   <fieldset>
     <legend>Residential Address</legend>
     
     <label for="raddress">Address:</label>
     <input type="text" id="raddress" name="raddress">
     
     <label for="rzip">Postal/Zip Code:</label>
     <input type="text" id="rzip" name="rzip">
     
     ...more residential address information...
   </fieldset>
   
   <fieldset>
     <legend>Postal Address</legend>
     
     <label for="paddress">Address:</label>
     <input type="text" id="paddress" name="paddress">
     
     <label for="pzip">Postal/Zip Code:</label>
     <input type="text" id="pzip" name="pzip">
     
     ...more postal address information...
   </fieldset>
</form>
```
{% endcode %}

## Providing additional information (A)

In the case of interactive elements (links, buttons and other form elements), if their text, value and label alone do not provide all the information that a sighted person can interpret visually, then it is written out as instructional text.

`<submit>` key at the end of a form is just “Go”. Then write that the form can be submitted with the large CTA button labeled _Go_ (brand color) Go at the end of the form.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```html
<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td colspan="2">Push the lower right [Preview] button.</td>
            <td><span style="">Print</span></td>
        </tr>
        
        <tr>
            <td><span style="">Cancel</span></td>
            <td><span style="">OK</span></td>
            <td><span style="">Preview</span></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
```
{% endcode %}

## `<nav>` element for related links (A)

If multiple navigation links belong together, put them in a common `<nav>` element.

The `<nav>` element is not just the main navigation of the page.

The `<nav>` element has a navigation role and should not be confused with the menu role, which is for the application menu (e**.**g. as in contextual links in Drupal).

Give the `<nav>` element a title with an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` property.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```html
<nav aria-label="primary">
    <a href="home.html">Home</a>
    <a href="about-us.html">About Us</a>
    <a href="products.html">Products</a>
</nav>

<nav aria-label="secondary">
    <a href="adverts.html">Our Advertisers</a>
    <a href="related.html">Related Links</a>
    <a href="subsidiaries.html">Subsidiaries</a>
</nav>
```
{% endcode %}

## The elements should come in a logical order (A)

In the DOM, the elements should follow each other as they relate to each other, not as the design requires.

If we take the CSS (e.g. reader view) off the page, we can read it nicely (and the additional elements should be related to the content) as they make sense and form a unified whole.

For example, on a typical product page:

1. name of Product
2. (if breadcrumb navigation, see parent categories)
3. product photo / gallery
4. product details (specification, price)
5. product description
6. add to cart button (this can be in several places, of course, but in the end it has the most space)
7. ancillary products
8. related / similar products
9. related articles
10. sidebar (anything not directly related to the content of this page)

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```html
<h1>My Museum Page</h1>

<ul id="nav">
    <li><a href="#">Link 1</a></li>
    ...
    <li><a href="#">Link 10</a></li>
</ul>

<div id="description">
    <h2>Mona Lisa</h2>    
    <p><img src="img.png" alt="Mona Lisa"></p>
    <p>...detailed description of the picture...</p>
</div>
```
{% endcode %}

## **Multidirectional Texts (A)**

Use `dir` property to indicate different text directions (screen reader knows from which direction to read)

Use the `lang` property to indicate texts in different languages (screen reader will know which text to interpret in which language, e**.**g. word _must_)

At least the `<html>` element must have a `dir` and a `lang` property! These will be the default values for the page, and if a different piece of text comes in, it will be marked separately. For example, in an Hungarian text, an English word comes in, then put that text in the `<span>` element and mark it with a `lang` property that it is an English text element. If, on the other hand, there is a Hebrew part within an English text, we must also expose the `dir` attribute in addition to `lang`.

{% embed url="https://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/" %}
unicode LRM and RLM meta characters for inline texts.
{% endembed %}

## Identify Input Purpose (AA)

The purpose of each input field collecting information about the user can be programmatically determined.

We should use the `autocomplete` attribute to input fields.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```html
<form method="post" action="step2">
    <div>
        <label for="fname">First Name</label>
        <input id="fname" type="text" autocomplete="given-name"...>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <label for="lname">Last Name Name</label>
        <input id="lname" type="text" autocomplete="family-name"...>
        
        <label for="cc-num">Credit card number:</label>
        <input type="text" id="cc-num" autocomplete="cc-number">
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <label for="exp-date">Expiry Date:</label>
        <input type="month" id="exp-date" autocomplete="cc-exp">
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <input type="submit" value="Continue...">
    </div>
</form>
```
{% endcode %}

{% embed url="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#input-purposes" %}
Here you can find the list the available values.
{% endembed %}

## Orientation (AA)

Use CSS to ensure that your page can be used not only in different resolutions, but also in landscape and portrait mode on the client device.

If necessary, use the show / hide functions.
