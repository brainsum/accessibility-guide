## Skip links (A)

Insert at least one Skip to Content link at the top of the page so that the user can access the content immediately. (Once you know what the intermediate blocks contain, you don't want to fight over and over again.)

You can also use such a link elsewhere on the page, e.g. a news page has smaller blocks of information at the top of the page, short news, in front of which we can put a Skip to Main article link.

Put a link at the beginning of a block that contains duplicate items (e.g. navigation, list block) to skip only that block.

The top Skip link can be a list of several links: we can provide direct links to different important parts of the page.

{% endcode %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
The target of a skip link should be a visible and focusable, so the user can visually follow it.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## WAI-ARIA Landmarks (A)

[As mentioned earlier](../1.-perceivable/1.3-adaptable.md), WCAG requires that the page be divided into top-level landmark areas for easier navigation.

[Each area must have an address](../1.-perceivable/1.3-adaptable.md#aria-labelledby-as-landmark-title-a) by which the user can clearly identify the area.

In addition to page areas, built-in widgets are also considered such areas, e.g. we need to add a `title` property to the `<iframe>` elements.

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```html
<header id="header" aria-labelledby="page-title">
    <img src="logo.svg">
    <h1 id="page-title">Page title</h1>
</header>

<div id="sitelookup" role="search" aria-labelledby="search-btn">
    <form>
        <input type="search" aria-labelledby="search-btn">
        <input id="search-btn" type="submit" value="Search">
    </form>
</div>

<nav id="nav" aria-label="Site navigation">a list of links here</nav>

<main id="content" aria-label="The main article">Ottawa is the capital of Canada</main>

<aside id="rightsideadvert" aria-label="Advertisement block">an advertisement here</aside>

<footer id="footer" aria-label="Site footer">(c)The Freedom Company, 123 Freedom Way, Helpville, USA</footer>
```
{% endcode %}

## The page title (A)

The `<title>` element of the page should be short and to the point.

Since screen readers will be the first to read this, it‚Äôs important to point out exactly what to expect on this site.

### Examples

**On the page for a smaller group of a larger organization:**

```html
<title>Working with us: The Small Group: The Big Organization</title>
```

**It is worthwhile to divide a subsidiary into 3 parts:**&#x20;

parent company - subsidiary - subpage:

```html
<title>WGBH - Media Access Group - Captioning FAQ</title>
```

**Home page of a news site:**

```html
<title>National News, Front Page, Oct 17, 2005</title>
```

## Visually hide an item (A)

Any item that, while unnecessary for a normal visitor to list, display, may have important information for accessibility techniques. For example, a title or a link.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Such elements can be visually hidden from CSS.**

But it's important not to display this hide with `display:none` or `visibility:hidden`, because they're actually taken out of the page's interpretation, and we can get it out of SEO.
{% endhint %}

This can also be supplemented with a focusable version, in which case the item will be displayed when it is in focus. Full code can be found in several frameworks, e.g. in [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/main/scss/mixins/\_visually-hidden.scss) or [Shake.sass](https://keeteean.github.io/shake.sass/#/6.utilities?id=visibility-utility) (part of Brainsum starter\_theme), but also part of Drupal 8 without a focusable version.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```css
.visually-hidden {
    position: absolute !important;
    width: 1px !important;
    height: 1px !important;
    padding: 0 !important;
    margin: -1px !important;
    overflow: hidden !important;
    clip: rect (0, 0, 0, 0) !important;
    white-space: nowrap !important;
    border: 0 !important;
}
```
{% endcode %}

## Purpose of the reference (A)

### **Proper link text content**

The content and text of the link must clearly indicate what the user can expect if they decide to follow the link.

Therefore, the following should be avoided at all costs:

* URL is also the text of the link,
* too general a word in the text of the reference, e.g.:&#x20;
  * Download,&#x20;
  * More,
  * Read more‚Ä¶,
  * See more,
  * Click here.

<pre class="language-html" data-line-numbers><code class="lang-html">&#x3C;a href="routes.html">
<strong>    Current routes at Boulders Climbing Gym
</strong>&#x3C;/a>
</code></pre>

{% code title="Alt text as link text" lineNumbers="true" %}
```html
<a href="routes.html">
    <img src="topo.gif" alt="Current routes at Boulders Climbing Gym" />
</a>
```
{% endcode %}

### Visually hidden text

If we cannot provide appropriate text as content, we can specify it in the `aria-label` property.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```html
<a href="taxhike.html" aria-label="Read more about Seminole tax hike">
    [Read more...]
</a>
```
{% endcode %}

A similar purpose is `aria-labelledby`, which allows you to use existing item(s) for this purpose. We can even concatenating link text from multiple sources:

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```html
<p>Download <span id="report-title">2012 Sales Report</span>:
   <a aria-labelledby="report-title pdf" href="#" id="pdf">PDF</a> |
   <a aria-labelledby="report-title doc" href="#" id="doc">Word</a> |
   <a aria-labelledby="report-title ppt" href="#" id="ppt">PowerPoint</a>
</p>
```
{% endcode %}

However using `aria` properties is totally valid, some tools not supports/likes that. In this case we could use additional invisible text for screen readers.

<pre class="language-html" data-line-numbers><code class="lang-html">&#x3C;a href="#">
    Read more
<strong>    &#x3C;span class="visually-hidden">about what Digital Access can do&#x3C;/span>
</strong>&#x3C;/a>
</code></pre>

### Use one link element to multiple elements

If consecutive elements refer to the same source, it can be confusing, always use only one reference: be in a common wrapper anchor element.

{% code title="wrapper link element" lineNumbers="true" %}
```html
<article>
    <a href="news.html">
        <h3>Budget Debate Continues in Parliament</h3>   
             
        <p class="subhead">        
            <img src="..." alt="..." height="..." width="...">
            Members of Parliament continued vigorous debate on three 
            challenging issues surrounding the upcoming year's budget.
        </p>      
          
        <p>Read more</p>
    </a>
</article>
```
{% endcode %}

Or use the Stretched link CSS trick included in [Bootstrap ](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/helpers/stretched-link/)or [Shake.sass ](https://keeteean.github.io/shake.sass/#/6.utilities?id=stretched-link-utility)(part of Brainsum starther\_theme); then we can extend the reference of a typical read more element to the whole wrapper element so that the whole one will be clickable.

{% code title="stretched link from Shake.sass" lineNumbers="true" %}
```html
<div class="o-media u-position-relative">
  <div class="o-media__fixed">
    <img src="..." alt="..." height="..." width="...">
  </div>
  
  <div class="o-media__fluid">
    <h5>Media with stretched link</h5>
    
    <p>Cras sit amet nibh libero, in gravida nulla. Nulla vel metus
    scelerisque ante sollicitudin. Cras purus odio, vestibulum in
    vulputate at, tempus viverra turpis.</p>
    
    <a href="#" class="u-stretched-link">Go somewhere</a>
  </div>
</div>
```
{% endcode %}

### The title property

Additional information about the purpose of the link can be provided using the `title` property, which the user knows better before following the link (e.g. a page with rough speech).

Because browsers interpret this differently (for example, for some hovers it displays it, for some it does not take it into account), we only use this to provide additional information, and we basically use the link text or aria property to provide information about the source.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```html
<a 
    href="https://save-elephants.com/article-2017-05-30.html" 
    title="Read more about failed elephant evacuation"
>
    Evacuation Crumbles Under Jumbo load
</a>
```
{% endcode %}

The value of `title` property must be different than the label. Ex.: the label for an anchor element (like in the above example) is the link text: _Evacuation Crumbles Under Jumbo load_. The title property only extends or explains this.

{% hint style="warning" %}
<mark style="color:orange;">**Be cautious!**</mark> <mark style="color:orange;"></mark><mark style="color:orange;">Use title property only for links or other interactive elements. Don't use it for</mark> <mark style="color:orange;"></mark><mark style="color:orange;">`<img>`</mark><mark style="color:orange;">or other static elements. In Drupal, the generated menu items could be</mark> <mark style="color:orange;"></mark><mark style="color:orange;">`<a>`</mark><mark style="color:orange;">,</mark> <mark style="color:orange;"></mark><mark style="color:orange;">`<span>`</mark> <mark style="color:orange;"></mark><mark style="color:orange;">or</mark> <mark style="color:orange;"></mark><mark style="color:orange;">`<button>`</mark> <mark style="color:orange;"></mark><mark style="color:orange;">elements, but the</mark> <mark style="color:orange;"></mark><mark style="color:orange;">`title`</mark> <mark style="color:orange;"></mark><mark style="color:orange;">property is invalid for</mark> <mark style="color:orange;"></mark><mark style="color:orange;">`<span>`</mark> <mark style="color:orange;"></mark><mark style="color:orange;">elements!</mark>
{% endhint %}

## Multiple paths (AA)

* Link the pages in some way with links (parent-child relationship, sibling relationship: see also).
* Add a list of all related content.
* `<link>` element to specify the switch pages**:**

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```html
<head>
    <link rel="Contents" href="Contents.html" title="Table of Contents">
    <link rel="Index" href="Index.html" title="Index">
    <link rel="Prev" href="Chapter01.html" title="01. Why Volunteer?">
    <link rel="Next" href="Chapter03.html" title="03. Who Volunteers?">
</head>
```
{% endcode %}

* Create content lists, indexes.
* Let's build the structure of the page in such a way that it is clear from it which pages belong together according to some logic. (eg in the case of a news portal, the sections, the chapters of a multi-page booking system, the purchase process or a digital book)
* From the main page, the user must be able to access all other existing pages, directly or indirectly.
* Provide a site map.
* Let the page have a search function.
* Provide several navigation menus: e.g. breadcrumb.

## Headings (AA)

The page headers (h1-h6) must be able to describe the content and structure of the page well.

If we only read the headers one after the other - like a table of contents, we need to see what the page is about.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```html
<h1>Disaster preparation</h1>
    <h2>Flood preparation</h2>
    <h2>Fire preparation</h2>
```
{% endcode %}

{% endembed %}

## Labels (AA)

For any element with which the user may interact, we need to provide a clear description of what we expect from him, how he can use it, e.g.:

* The labels for the two name fields on the form are `First name` and `Last name`.
* Map zoom button labels: `Zoom in (Ctrl + Shift + L)` and `Zoom out (Ctrl + Shift + R)`.
* Write in the label of the required fields of the form that it is mandatory.

## Visible focus status (AA)

With keyboard control, it is essential for the browser to be able to provide visual feedback when an item is in focus.

Do not disable it in CSS, do not just change the color, if possible do not match it to another state, and if possible use a uniform notation (focus state should be similar regardless of the type of element).

Make sure the focus marker has [the right color contrast ratio](../1.-perceivable/1.4-distinguishable.md#contrast-ratio-aa).

If you do not change the appearance of the `:focus` state, the operating system provides what the user can change to make it as visible as possible.

## Position (AAA)

Ensure in as many ways as possible where the user is going, in which page, section, area:

* Mark the current page in the navigation menu (s).
* Use breadcrumbs, for example: `You are here: Acme Company ‚Üí Electronics ‚Üí Computers ‚Üí Laptops`
* Use a site map.
* If there is a parent or child item, please also mark them (where I am, where I came from, where I can go).
* If you are walking on a deep side, indicate which part of the side you are on.
* `:visited` links (not use the same CSS rules for `:link` and `:visited` states).
