## The language of the page and its parts

### Set the default language (A)

[Specify the default language for the page](../1.-perceivable/1.3-adaptable.md#multidirectional-texts-a) - html element and HTTP header.

### Mark different language blocks (AA)

Blocks written in a language other than the default language should also be marked.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```html
<html lang="en-gb">
    [...]
    
    <blockquote lang="de">
        <p>
            Da dachte der Herr daran, ihn aus dem Futter zu schaffen,
            aber der Esel merkte, daÃŸ kein guter Wind wehte, lief fort
            und machte sich auf den Weg nach Bremen: dort, meinte er,
            kÃ¶nnte er ja Stadtmusikant werden.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
</html>
```
{% endcode %}

## Unusual Words (AAA)

If we use a word or expression that differs from its general use and meaning, we use it for something else in the given context (eg driver), then we indicate:

### Wording tools

e.g. expressed in parentheses

### Definition in the `<dfn>` element

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```markup
<p>
    The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines require that non-text content 
    has a text alternative. <dfn>Non-text content</dfn> is content that is 
    not a sequence of characters that can be programmatically determined or 
    where the sequence is not expressing something in human language; this 
    includes ASCII Art (which is a pattern of characters), emoticons, 
    leetspeak (which is character substitution), and images representing 
    text.
</p>
```
{% endcode %}

### Linking a definition

e.g. `#anchor` element

### Creating a glossary

e.g. if you are creating a separate glossary page (preferably with a search box), add a `<link>` element to your pages with a `rel="glossary"` property in the `<header>`:

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```html
<link rel="glossary" href="https://www.example.com/my-glossary">
```
{% endcode %}

### Description list (`<dl>`)

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```html
<dl title="Nautical terms">
    <dt>Knot</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>A <em>knot</em> is a unit of speed equaling 1 nautical mile per 
        hour (1.15 miles per hour or 1.852 kilometers per hour).</p>
    </dd>
    
    <dt>Port</dt>
    <dd>
        <p><em>Port</em> is the nautical term (used on boats and ships) 
        that refers to the left sideof a ship, as perceived by a person 
        facing towards the bow (the front of the vessel).</p>
    </dd>
</dl>
```
{% endcode %}

## Abbreviations (AAA)

If we use acronyms and abbreviations that are difficult to deduce, e.g. have been taken over from another language, let us also explain their unabridged form:

### Wording tools

e.g. expressed in parentheses

### `<abbr>` element

Preferably do not use CSS to distinguish it. Luckily there is a Drupal CKEditor plugin for this.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```html
<p>
    The use of <abbr title="Keep It Simple Stupid">KISS</abbr> became popular 
    in ...
</p>
```
{% endcode %}

### Linking a definition

e.g. `#anchor` element

### Creating a glossary

e.g. if you are creating a separate glossary page (preferably with a search box), add a `<link>` element to your pages with a `rel="glossary"` property in the `<header>`:

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```html
<link rel="glossary" href="https://www.example.com/my-glossary">
```
{% endcode %}

## Reading level (AAA)

People who are having reading or interpreting problems should also be able to understand the text.

If the content requires a certain level of education based on UNESCO education levels (primary, secondary, tertiary), this will be indicated and, if possible, the text will be made available to users with lower education.

Such methods may include:

* preparation of a short, comprehensible summary,
* provide as many visual or audio-visual additions as possible,
* provide an audio version (there are users who have difficulty reading comprehension but are able to decode what is being said much better in other ways (e.g. by hearing))
* also provide a sign language version,
* make the text easier to read:

## Different pronunciation (AAA)

When pronouncing a word is not clear, provide pronunciation:

### **Wording tools**

Immediately after the word in parentheses

### Provide a link to the right pronunciation

e.g. online dictionary

### Creating a glossary

### Provide diacritical writing

that can be turned on/off

### Use the `<ruby>` HTML tag

Especially useful for Asian languages.
